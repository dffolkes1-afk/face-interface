Public execution surface.

## Overview

FACE is the **only system the public ever sees**.

It does not think.
It does not measure.
It does not decide.

FACE only **renders authorized outputs**
from sovereign internal systems.

---

## Purpose

FACE exists to answer one question:

**“What is safe, permitted, and accurate to show?”**

It transforms internal scores into:
- Visual indicators
- Percentages
- Status signals
- Public-facing confirmations

---

## What FACE Displays

- Approved scores
- Performance states
- Threshold indicators
- Stability markers
- System confirmations

---

## What FACE Does NOT Do

- It does not calculate
- It does not score
- It does not infer intent
- It does not store raw data

FACE has zero authority.

---

## Data Flow

- **NIMROD → FACE**
- **VoiceScore → NIMROD → FACE**
- **FACE ↛ Internal Systems**

FACE is downstream only.

---

## Disclosure Control

All outputs are:
- Pre-approved
- Filtered
- Bounded by visibility rules
- Jurisdiction-aware

FACE never leaks logic.

---

## Governance

- Public-safe
- Read-only
- Revocable displays
- No override power

---

## Status

Public  
Surface-only

Replaceable without risk
